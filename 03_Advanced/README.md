**Enumarte function** : Enumerate function is a built-in function that allows to iterate through a sequence and keep track of the index of each element

**Map function** : Map function works as an iterator to return a result after applying a function to every item of an iterable (tuple,lists, etc…). For complex transformations, it can be faster than list comprehensions 

**Filter function** : Filter function is a built-in function that allows to process an iterable and extract those items that satisfy a given condition.

**Yield** : yield is used in a function like a ‘return’ statement, but instead of terminating the function and returning a value, ‘yield’ pauses the function state. The function can later resume from where it left off, allowing it to produce a series of values over time, instead of computing them all at once and returning a list. When a function contains a ‘yield’ statement, it becomes a generator function. 

**Constants** : Constants are used to represent fixed values that should not be modified during the execution of a program, but they can be defined using dictionaries which are mutable. 

**With** : The ‘with’ statement is used for simplifying exception handling and resource management in certain scenarios, particularly when dealing with file handling and database connections. 

**Objects in functions** : Objects in functions are used for several reasons explained all above such as encapsulation, reusability, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, organisation and state machine. Objects can hold state, which means they can maintain data over time. 
Functions can manipulate this state, allowing it to perform actions that change the object’s properties and behaviour. 

**Argpase** : Parsing refers to the process of analysing a sequence of characters to extract meaningful information or to translate it into a structure that can be used in your program. The ‘argpase’ module allows parsing command-line arguments. 

**Unit Testing** : Unit testing is typically done using the built-in ‘unittest’ framework, which provides a test discovery mechanism and a test runner.
